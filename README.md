locale-sh: a Java Locale Service Provider for Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian
======================================================================

The locale-sh package provides LocaleServiceProvider implementations for locales of the Serbo-Croatian language family. The original intention was to just create locale definitions for Bosnian (“bs”), which were still missing from Sun’s JRE at the time of creating this project. However, it now also has ekavian Serbian definitions for the Latin script (Sun only ships a Cyrillic variant) when used as sh_RS (Serbo-Croatian language, country Serbia) and Croatian definitions when used as sh_HR. The package includes mainly number and date formats, as well as some support for collation and localised locale names.

This project is no longer under development. It's kept here for archival purposes.
